"""Find the rooms, seats, gates, windows and courtyards inside each photographed
structure, so a camera can be planned *inside* the build rather than orbiting it.

The orbit planner needs only a bounding box. An interior planner needs to know
where the furniture is: which floor level is the main hall, which chair faces a
table, which wall opening is a window and which is the front gate. All of that
is in the world save — the StewardView DuckDB cache stores every ZDO with its
prefab name and position — it has just never been pulled out per structure.

Names, not categories. The viewer's own category census calls a hearth INTERIOR
and a chair FURNITURE-ish depending on its classification file; this scan
matches on prefab_name directly (the cache resolves 99.6% of rows using the
same committed prefab dump this repo carries), so a chair is a chair no matter
how the viewer filed it.

Cluster identity is frozen. out/clusters.json is the gallery's join key —
cluster ids come from union-find ordering and a re-scan can renumber them — so
this scan NEVER re-clusters. Features are assigned to the existing clusters by
padded bounding-box containment (nearest centre wins a tie), and the per-cluster
piece recount doubles as a drift report against the frozen scan.

No rotation. The cache does not store ZDO orientation, so a chair's facing is
unknowable here. The planner compensates by aiming at nearby features (the
table, the fire, the window) instead of down the chair's axis — which is the
better photograph anyway.

Outputs out/features.json (gitignored — real coordinates) for plan_interiors.py.

Usage:
  python scan_features.py [--db PATH] [--clusters out/clusters.json]
